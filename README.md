<h1>Hi, I'm Kyle! <br/></h1>
<h5>I am currently with attending a Junior Data Engineer Bootcamp with Generation Singapore, where I have been exposed to an extensive range of data engineering tools, programming languages such as Python and SQL, essential project management methodologies and frameworks, which aided in my understanding of how Data works inside out. 

I really enjoyed working with my team mates on the Twitter Crawler Project, where we had to perform data scraping from Twitter itself via an API and display understanding of ETL, EDA and ERD design by implementing data cleaning, wrangling and transformation, topping that up with a new process called Sentiment Analysis. We managed to complete the entire project using Python and SQL.

We are currently working on a large scale dataset where we had to perform the above, alongside with transliterating and translation. By putting the Agile SCRUM methodology to practice, we were able to "fail fast" and get on with other possible solutions and came up with an effective ERD. By tidying up our data accordingly, we were able to display a series of visualization on Power BI which facilitates the understanding of the data on a deeper level.

On the whole, the entire experience with Generation Singapore is superb and I definitely feel much more competent after the completion of this bootcamp. My understanding has improved tremendously over such a short period of time and everyone including my cohort mates, instructor and Generation Singapore has been incredibly supportive.</h5>
